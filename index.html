        <h2>Additional information</h2>
        <p>I'd worked as the Digital Manager for six years. I participated in advertising hundreds of startups and hundreds of big businesses.
            My mission was helping entrepreneurs and businesses increase their sales no matter what. 
            So `no matter what` means that I was doing everything. 
            I worked as an advertiser, a digital analytic, a copywriter, a designer, and of course as a programmer. 
            And over time I began to delve into programming which seemed like magic to me, and it began to make sense. 
            I started studying programming deeply for fun. Firstly, I automated a routine.
            
            Plots and reports that I'd built in Excel for hours, my scripts built for several minutes or seconds. 
            I felt this power and gone farther and farther. 
            And the second thing that I automated was creating advertising. 
            My career's been going well since I started to learn programming. Clients were excited because their tasks were doing faster. 
            And one of the moments I thought that my new mission is to be useful as a programmer. 
            Since this moment I with hard and pleasure study programming and waiting for a new challenge.
